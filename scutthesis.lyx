An organ system is a multi-organ system that functions together to undergo
 crucial functions to meet the physiological needs of the body.
 A human body is a multiplex organ system consisting of trillions of cells,
 which all require oxygen, nutrients and signaling molecules.
 These functions are performed by the circulatory system comprising of the
 cardiovascular and the lymphatic circulatory system Figure

The adult human heart is approximately around the size of a fist, and measures
 about 250-350 grams and beats on an average of about 60–70 times per minute
 and is situated in the thoracic cavity, stretches obliquely from the second
 rib to the fifth intercostal space, residing on the superior surface of
 the diaphragm.
 It is encapsulated in the double-walled sac called the pericardium, a serous
 membrane inhabiting the middle mediastinum

The structure of a mammalian heart
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A mature mammalian heart contains four chambers (right atrium, left atrium,
 right ventricle, left ventricle) and four valves (pulmonary valve, PV;
 tricuspid valve, TV; atrial valve, AV; mitral valve, MV).
 The wall of each chamber consists of three tissue layers: endocardium,
 myocardium and epicardium (Modified from Lin CJ, 2012).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Pericardium has two layers; epicardium and the myocardium.
 The inner layer is the myocardium and comprises mainly of cardiac muscle
 and shapes the bulk of the heart.
 The cardiac muscular layer: myocardium contracts and binds to one another
 by crisscrossing tissue fibers positioned in circular bundles.
 These bundles connect all parts of the heart together.
 Endocardium, a white sheet of endothelium cells (squamous epithelium),
 rests on the connective tissue layer.
 Located on the inner myocardial surface it lines the chambers of the heart.
 The endocardium has endothelial linings of the blood vessels leaving and
 entering the heart.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Blood flow through the heart and lungs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The cardiac chambers and valves are organized such that they separate systemic
 from pulmonary circulation and ensure directional blood flow.
 The four chambered mammalian heart receives deoxygenated blood from the
 body through the superior and inferior vena cava.
 Via the right atrium, the blood reaches the right ventricle, from where
 it is pumped through the pulmonary artery into the lungs.
 Oxygenated blood from the lungs returns to the heart through the pulmonary
 veins and the left atrium.
 The left ventricle pumps the blood into the aorta and back into the systemic
 circulation.
 This process of blood circulation continues as long as the individual remains
 alive Figure

.
 The contraction of the heart sets off as the electrical impulses initiate
 in the sinus node inhabiting the apex of the right atrium.
 The impulse is then further transmitted to the secondary cardiac pacemaker,
 the atrioventricular node, and later to the bundle of His and the Purkinje
 fibers

Embryonic Development of the Heart
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Heart is the first entirely functional organ in the process of embryonic
 development.
 Overall, in all higher vertebrates, the cardiac development obeys the same
 standardized pattern: initiating with the fusion of myocardium and endocardium
 in ventral midline to build a simpler tubular heart; followed by the onset
 of function, looping to the right side; chamber specification and formation;
 and terminating at the development of specialized conduction tissue, coronary
 circulation, innervation, and mature valves development

 Preliminary cardiac development is finalized by day 50.
 It starts its function and circulation of blood begins during the 4th week
 when the nutritional and oxygen requirements of the growing embryo can
 no longer be provided by the process of diffusion from the placenta.
 On the contrary, maturation processes like ventricular and atrial septation
 continues until the birth

chorionic sac to embryo.
 The umbilical arteries carry poorly oxygenated blood and waste products
 from the embryo to the chorionic sac (outermost embryonic membrane) (Figure
 Modified from Moore, KL 2015).
 Located in the bilaterally paired cardiogenic fields in the splanchnic
 layer of anterior lateral plate mesodermal origin the earliest progenitors
 of the heart are present and during gastrulation, these cells immigrate
 to the cranial side of the embryonic disc.
 The heart formation begins near the cardiogenic area.
 At embryonic day 7.5, they form the two heart fields that fusing at the
 midline to form a crescent, also referred to as the primary heart field

.
 This region gives rise to the tubular heart containing of the outer myocardium
 and the inner endocardium.
 The initial cardiac progenitor cells are marked by the expression of the
 transcription factors MESP1 and MESP2 which contributes to all cardiac
 lineages.
 Eventually, when the cardiac crescent is formed, these progenitors are
 marked by the transcription factors GATA4 and NKX2.5, whose expression is
 induced by members of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF), wingless type
 (WNT) families and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) families

 During the rightward looping, the progenitor cells protruding outside of
 the primary heart field contributes progressively to the poles of the elongatin
g heart tube.
 The source of this new myocardium was first identified in 2001 as a cell
 population located in the pharyngeal mesoderm defined as the secondary
 heart field (SHF)
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "8_Waldo2001,9_Bajolle2008"

\end_inset

.
 Cells of the SHF contribute to the outflow tract (OT), right ventricle
 and inflow region of the heart, with the OT being an exclusive derivative
 of the SHF.
 The SHF intercepts signals from surrounding cell types including the pharyngeal
 endoderm, ectoderm and mesoderm as well as neural crest (NC) cells.
 Cardiac progenitor cells in the SHF are further distinguished by the expression
 of the transcription factors ISL1 and TBX1 and the growth factors FGF8
 and FGF10.
 Additionally, they are later characterized by a continued proliferation
 and a delay of differentiation, which is regulated by a complex interplay
 of signals including the FGF, BMP, Wnt, Hedgehog (Hh) and Notch pathways

.
 The extension of primary and secondary heart fields gives rise to primitive
 atria and ventricles.
 The center of the heart tube becomes twisted to form the ventricular loop,
 which at the end forms left and right ventricles.
 On day 9, the formation of truncus arteriosus, endocardial cushions and
 future valves of the heart takes place
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

.
 The ventricular surface is encapsulated by the epicardial cells on day
 10 excluding the truncus arteriosus, which is enveloped by epicardial cells
 on day 11.
 The sub-epicardial connective tissue and capillary containing blood cells
 are detected on the 11th day.
 By the day 15, septum in atria and ventricles, and valve are formed.
 The left ventricle and left and right atria are formed by primary heart
 field, whereas the secondary heart field gives rise to the right ventricle,
 the outflow tract, and the left and right atria
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "6_Nandi2015"

\end_inset

.
 The elongation and looping of the heart tube leads to parallel arrangement
 of the future cardiac chambers.
 The following septation process leads to the formation of the atrioventricular
 septum from the atrioventricular cushions and to the septation of the OT
 based on the truncal and conal cushions.
 These endocardial cushions are formed by the collection of extracellular
 matrix between the endocardium and myocardium and they are also involved
 in the formation of the mitral and tricuspid (atrioventricular) valves
 as well as the aortic and pulmonic (semilunar) valves, respectively.
 Furthermore, the cardiac pacemaking and conduction system as well as the
 coronary system are developed from regions of specialized myocardium and
 the ventricular wall undergoing trabeculation and compaction, ultimately
 leading to the characteristic myocardial structure crucial for the normal
 contractile functioning of the heart

progenitors migrate to the splanchnic mesoderm to form the cardiac crescent.
 At E7.5 in the mouse, the cardiac crescent can be divided into two heart
 field lineages based on differential gene expression and their respective
 contribution to heart, a first heart field (red) and a second heart field
 (yellow), which is located posteriorly and medially to the first heart
 field.
 At E8.0, the linear heart tube is present.
 At E8.5, the looping is associated with uneven growth of cardiac chambers.
 The outflow tract is at the arterial pole and the inflow tract and primitive
 atria are at the venous pole.
 By E9.5, the common atrium has moved superior to the ventricles and is separated
 by a distinct atrio-ventricular canal.
 By E10.5, cardiac neural crest cells from the dorsal neural tube migrate
 via the pharyngeal arches to the cardiac outflow tract.
 Further cardiac development involves a series of septation events and myocardia
l trabeculation that result in a mature four-chambered heart integrated
 with the circulatory system depicted at E15.5 (Figure Modified from Jonathan
 A.
 Epstein 2015).

 Fetal heart progenitor cells are differentiated into specific lineages
 to form specific types of cells.
 The differentiation of these cells into a particular lineage is a confined
 regulatory process, which is based on the microenvironment and the signaling
 cues in the extracellular matrix.
 Deregulation of the regulatory genes involved in lineage determination,
 differentiation, or cardiac development leads to the fetal heart failure,
 and may also end up in embryonic lethality.
 Inability to contract and malfunctioning of the myocardial compliance as
 a result of hemodynamic stress amplify the incidence of fetal heart failure

 of cardiac progenitor cells and trans-differentiation of fibroblasts into
 cardiomyocytes can be induced for the therapy of heart failure.

Congenital Heart Disease

\begin_layout Standard
In In the process of embryogenesis of heart, a wide range of deficits arise,
 amongst which congenital heart disease (CHD) is frequent.
 These deficits have direct relationship on the functioning of heart.
 CHD is the structural and / or functional deficits and is mainly non-infectious
 cause of birth defects with a prevalence of about eight out of every 1,000
 children born, and remains leading cause of morbidity and mortality in
 childhood, responsible for approximately 10% of all infant death

 Sommer,Wang & Yang found that a broad range of congenital heart diseases
 may either be isolated or interlinked with other cardiac anomalies, which
 results in a wide spectrum of conditions including; degraded quality of
 life cardiac enlargement, infective endocarditis, thromboembolism, reduced
 exercise capacity, pulmonary hypertension, congestive heart failure, delayed
 fatal brain development, Eisenmenger's syndrome, moreover arrhythmias,
 and even sudden cardiac death

Prevalence of Congenital Heart Disease
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
According Former studies suggest prevalence and pattern of a group of genetic
 disorders associated with CHD varies both within and among regions and
 countries.
 In North America, the preponderance of CHD (8.1 per 1000 live births) is
 less than that of Asia (9.3 per 1000 live births), whereas in Africa its
 frequency is is skyrocketing.
 Unfavourable socio-economic environment in Africa and the lack of accurate
 diagnostic techniques by genetic laboratories, including inadequate prenatal
 diagnosis that early detects genetic diseases hence becomes CHDs main cause.
 CHD may also question the physiological, emotional, and socioeconomic state
 of patients’ families and society.
 The fundamental research endeavour is not only to identify the reasons
 behind CHD, but also to contribute to the healthcare of growing community

.
 Over a decade, remarkable progress has been made in elucidating the etiology
 of CHD, but the defined mechanisms behind it in majority of the patients
 still remains unknown.
 Currently near about half of the infant morbidity is due to CHD.
 On the contrary, with the application of state-of the-art advancements
 in the prenatal diagnosis, corrective strategies, and longitudinal care
 a decrease in the infantile mortality rate has been seen.
 Additionally, advances in cardiovascular medicine and surgery have led
 to significant improvements in the treatment of CHD.
 In the past, most patients with CHD died in early childhood.
 Today, about 75% of CHD patients surviving the first year of life will
 also reach adulthood and the number of adult patients now surpass that
 of children with CHD

 In U.S, an estimated amount of nearly 760,000 individuals with CHD born
 after 1989 are predicted to remain alive by the year 2020.
 In Germany, a prevalence of approximately 280,000 individuals with CHD
 in 2020 is expected, with about 180,000 individuals being at least 18 years
 old.
 Nevertheless, CHD patients are at a great risk of long-term complications
 like arrhythmias, sudden cardiac death, aortic dissection and pulmonary
 regurgitation

The most likely scenario is that the etiology of disease involves multiple
 factors, including different genetic loci, environmental influences, epigenetic
 factors (eg, DNA methylation or histone modifications) and miRNA dysfunction
 and /or a combination of these factors (Figure modified from Cecilia Vecoli
 2014).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Environmental factors
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The intrauterine environment of the developing embryo/foetus is effected
 by several maternal factors such as health/disease status, lifestyle, medicatio
n, exposure to environmental teratogens, (such as environmental pollutants,
 including dioxins, dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls), dioxin exposure
 in adulthood has been associated with hypertension and cardiovascular disease.
 Some pesticides (such as methyl parathion), maternal exposures to alcohol,
 smoking, isotretinoin, thalidomide, antiseizure medications, antithyroid
 drug (ATD) such as methimazole/carbimazole can induce disruptions during
 early embryonic development and has been reported as a primary cause of
 CHD risk factors and infectious agent (such as rubella), rubella infection
 of the foetus causes congenital rubella syndrome (CRS), resulting in severe
 morbidities of childhood blindness, deafness, heart disease, and mental
 retardation

Chromosomal
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The primary genetic factors for CHD are Chromosomal and monogenetic abnormalitie
s (about 8% of the cases), multifactorial abnormalities (9% of the cases)
 and environmental teratogens (2% of the cases).
 Renowned causes leading to CHDs are: sporadic genetic variations, point
 mutations, deletion and duplications.
 CHD mutations arise as autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive or X-linked
 traits that are expressed with high penetrance and with versatile clinical
 manifestations.
 Furthermore, CHD is genetically heterogeneous.
 Hundreds of autosomal dominant or X-linked mutations have been identified
 in hereditary forms of CHD.
 Autosomal recessive or somatic mutations and polygenic variants create
 alternative genetic models to account for the population prevalence of
 CHD.
 Some cases of CHD might cause in somatic mutations in monogenic genes that
 develop during the early development of cardiac progenitor cells.
 It is identified that Chromosomal aneuploidy, being the first recognized
 genetic cause of CHD, occurs in approximately 40% to 50% of trisomy 21
 (1in 600 births), 25% to 35% of Turner syndrome (45,X) (1 in 2500 female
 births), and in almost all cases of both trisomy 13and trisomy 18

Genetic factors

\begin_layout Standard
Studies demonstrated that transcription factors play a pivotal role during
 heart development.
 Hundreds of genes have been disclosed to be involved in the murine heart
 development.
 In the heart development, GATA binding protein 4 (GATA4), NK2 homeobox5
 (NKX2.5), T-box 5 (TBX5), Zic family member 3(ZIC3), myosin heavy chain
 6 (MYH6) and NOTCH with cross communication, ligand-receptor interactions,
 complex signal transduction pathways, and a network of transcription factors
 affecting the expression of cardiac specific genes of heart, plays a key
 role

.
 A number of CHDs can occur due to mutations in more than one gene (genetic
 heterogeneity), and mutations in one gene can cause a diverse range of
 CHDs (phenotypic heterogeneity).
 Cardiac malformations can arise as isolated defects or may turn up as features
 of syndromic disorders that show a wide range of additional non-cardiac
 symptoms like skeletal anomalies, mental disabilities, distinctive facial
 features and renal anomalies.
 Likewise, they can be caused by a variety of different genetic aberrations.
 Transcription factors and associated genes Alterations in the heart muscle
 specific MYH6 (α-myosin heavy chain) and several proteins that are linked
 with MYH6 such as GATA4 that forms a complex with the TBX5 (T-box gene
 5) ultimately results in atrial septal defects
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "17_Marelli2007"

\end_inset

.
 Mutations have been reported in the homebox transcription factor NKX2.5
 in a family suffering from ASD along with conduction delay and in the transcrip
tion factor GATA4 in a family is noted with isolated septal defects.
 Several pathways are involved in the cardiac development and a change in
 any of these three genes can lead to a cardiac defect.
 Single TF mutations In humans, the clinical range of deformities arising
 from single TF mutations is extremely broad and the genotype-phenotype
 relationship is highly complex.
 Changes in GATA4 gene can cause both inherited septation defects and atrioventr
icular canal.
 Alterations in the NKX2.5 gene were reported as a genetic cause of various
 CHD phenotypes (e.g.
 atrial /ventricular septal defects, coarctation of aorta) comprising electrophy
siological alterations alike the TBX5 gene
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "17_Marelli2007"

\end_inset

.
 Another reason behind the cause of syndromic and non- syndromic disorders
 may be defects in single genes.
 Examples include; Allagille syndrome caused by mutations in NOTCH2or JAG1.
 Holt-Oram syndrome is caused by defects in TBX5.
 Another TBX gene, the TBX1 results in DiGeorge Syndrome, which has symptoms
 and features including defects of the cardiac outflow tract and Tetralogy
 of Fallot (TOF).
 In TOF, the ventricular septal defect (VSD) mixes oxygenated and deoxygenated
 blood in the left ventricle

 A deformity may arise from different embryological mechanisms, and this
 is described as the ‘One heart disease—several mechanisms—several genes’
 concept.
 In addition, disability of these different mechanisms may originate a wide
 range of heart diseases.
 These concepts henceforth elucidate the genetic heterogeneity of a single

Epigenetic mechanisms
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The maintenance of heart development is essentially the function of the
 T-box transcription factors.
 These factors have a direct relationship in controlling gene transcription,
 however, in addition to this they are intimately related to developmental
 processes through interactions with epigenetic control mechanisms.
 These complexes change chromatin by modifying and remodeling factors as
 a result of which activation and repression of DNA transcription takes
 place.
 The development of eukaryotes demands for epigenetic mechanisms to control
 gene transcription for regulating cell specification and differentiation.
 Chromatin rearrangement is essential vital epigenetic mechanism for the
 regulation of gene.
 At the epigenetic level, transcription factors are monitored by the arrangement
 of DNA into higher-order chromatin structures

DNA is organized in chromatin composed of condensed nucleosomes: units of
 146 bp of DNA wrapped twice around an octamer of two copies of each histone
 protein H2A, H2B, H3, and H4.
 The flexible amino-terminal tails of the histones, protruding outward from
 the nucleosome, allow for post-translational modifications through (de)acethyla
tion, phosporylation, ubiquitination, methylation, and sumoylation.
 Such covalent modifications alter DNA–histone interactions, affecting accessibi
lity of transcription factors.
 Chromatin plays an important role in the regulation of gene expression.
 It is highly structured and can be compacted to varying degrees, which
 impacts on the accessibility of the DNA for the transcription machinery.
 The basic unit of chromatin is the nucleosome, consisting of 146 base pairs
 (bp) of DNA wrapped around eight histone proteins.
 A number of epigenetic mechanisms control the chromatin structure, including
 chromatin remodeling complexes, modifications and variants of histone proteins
 as well as modifications of the DNA itself

 Histones are small globular proteins that are highly conserved and can
 undergo various post-translational modifications, such as methylation,
 acetylation or phosphorylation on their N-terminal tails.
 These modifications act either directly on chromatin structure by altering
 electrostatic charges and thereby internucleosomal contacts or serve as
 targeting signals for chromatin remodeling complexes or other chromatin-binding
 proteins.
 Different modifications can function as activators or repressors of transcripti
on [46, 47].
 Epigenetics is henceforth the amalgamation of all the processes that are
 in charge of the expression of the genes involved in the normal development
 of all tissues and organs including; the DNA sequences that code for structural
 proteins, or those that are responsible for the regulatory proteins such
 as transcription factors

 Among the various epigenetic mechanisms, aberrant DNA methylation has been
 distinctly linked to a number of diseases.
 By the addition of a methyl group in the 5′ carbon of cytosine a change
 in the structure of the DNA molecule occurs leading to a wide range of
 possible alterations of gene expression pattern.
 Conclusively, aberrant DNA methylation with its transcriptional consequences
 might have a significant role in causing human disease

 The physiological approach is to sub-divide these into either cyanotic
 or acyanotic lesions.
 Cyanotic lesions have deoxygenated blood in the systemic circulation as
 a result of either (a) reduced blood flow to the pulmonary circulation
 with obligatory right to left shunting, or (b) an increased blood flow
 to the pulmonary circulation leading to increased pulmonary vascular resistance
 with a late onset of right to left shunt.
 Acyanotic lesions comprise those with (a) simple left to right shunts,
 or (b) obstructive outflow or regurgitated valves.
 However, the anatomical approach is to divide them into either simple or
 complex lesions.

 CHD contains a heterogeneous group of cardiac deformities influencing different
 structures of the heart and can be further divided into three main categories,
 namely; septation defects, cyanotic heart disease and left-sided obstruction
 defects.
 Septation defects can affect the atria (atrial septal defect, ASD), the
 ventricles (ventricular septal defect, VSD) or structures in the central
 part of the heart (atrioventricular septum defect, AVSD).
 Cyanotic heart defects lead to a bluish appearance of the skin due to mixing
 of deoxygenated and oxygenated blood; this condition is also known as the
 “blue baby syndrome”.
 Furthermore, underlying malformations include; Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF),
 transposition of the great arteries (TGA), double outlet right ventricle
 (DORV), Ebstein’s anomaly, and persistent truncus arteriosus (PTA).
 Left-sided obstructive lesions contains diseases like hypo plastic left
 heart syndrome, mitral or aortic stenosis and aortic coarctation

Atrial septal defect (ASD)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Atrial septal defect (ASD) is a congenital cardiac disorder and occurs widely
 in females rather than males, as a result of the spontaneous malformation
 in the interatrial septum / opening in the atrial septum (septa are physical
 extensions of the myocardium lined with endocardium, located between the
 two atria), allowing the blood to transfer directly between the left and
 right atrium.
 Atrial septation is defined as the division of a common atrium into the
 left and right atrium that are noticed in a structurally well-developed,
 four chambered tetrapod heart.
 Adding to this, the atrial septum is developed by three distinct structures
 that undertakes concurrent morphogenesis: the atrioventricular endocardial
 cushions, the primary atrial septum (PAS), and the spina vestibuli or dorsal
 mesenchymal protrusion (SV/DMP)

ASD was initially described by Rokitansky in 1875.

 From the roof of the atrium, between the systemic and pulmonary venous
 openings a muscular shelf - “septum primum” – grows which later fuses with
 the superior endocardial cushion at the atrioventricular level.
 The interatrial linkage that exists before this fusion is called “ostium
 primum”.
 However, before the closure of the ostium primum, the upper part of the
 primary septum is fragmented down creating a new interatrial communication
 – the “ostium secundum”.
 When the ostium primum is annihilated, the expansion of a posterior structure,
 spina vestibuli, also plays a crucial role.
 It is further encapsulated by muscles, thus making the base of the primary
 septum stronger.
 The upper and thinner part of the fibromuscular primary septum will then
 serve as the flap valve of foramen ovale.
 At this point, the roof of the primary atrium, between the systemic and
 pulmonary venous entrances, initiates unfolding, thereby creates the secondary
 septum –“septum secundum” that will form the upper rims of the foramen
 ovale.
 Still, the secondary septum is not a true septum but rather it is sandwich-like
 in-folding of the atrial wall compiled with extracardiac adipose tissue.
 This interatrial groove is often referred to as Söndergaard’s or Waterston’s
 groove”.
 Atrial septal “lipoma” or “lipomateous hypertrophy” is a common echocardiograph
ic finding and, the denomination proposes involvement of the septum whereas
 it is actually an extracardiac fat.
 By the 12th week of development the right and left pulmonary venous become
 separated and the atrial septation is terminated.

\begin_layout Standard
(A) At 28 days after gestation, septum primum (Sep 1°)—the first septum
 to appear in the developing atria— develops as a crescent-shaped structure.
 Its leading edge is covered by a layer of mesenchymal cells called mesenchymal
 cap (shown in red).
 The space between the developing septum primum and the developing endocardial
 cushions is called foramen primum or ostium primum.
 Septum secundum (Sep 2°; limbus of the fossa ovalis) is a crescent-shaped
 muscular infolding of the atria wall that appears shortly thereafter to
 the right of septum primum.
 (B) At 35 days, both septum primum and septum secundum continue to develop.
 The openings within septum primum are called foramina secundi.
 (C) At 60 days, the atrial septum is nearly fully formed and the foramina
 secundi close by way of coalescing fenestrations within septum primum.
 The foramen ovale remains patent throughout pregnancy.

Incidence and causes of ASDs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The reported incidence of congenital heart disease varies a lot, /1000 live
 births and there are a number of reasons for this.
 Most studies are merely restricted to infancy or childhood and do not count
 lesions detected later in life.
 This has a significant relevance for ASD, which often is diagnosed in adult
 life.
 Previous studies reporting the highest incidences are characterized by
 a frequent use of echocardiography in a neonatal setting or during infancy
 and, it is thus very obvious that the principal reason for the increase
 of the incidence of CHD reported in recent years is the detection of mild
 forms, particularly small ventricular septal defects.
 Besides, small ASDs of the secundum type are also abundantly found, yet
 it seems that the spontaneous closure rate is higher than formerly thought.
 In addition to the diagnostic methodology and the age profile of the investigat
ed population, referral patterns will play a major role in retrospective
 studies based on a huge population.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Resent findings reveals that despite the high prevalence and the significant
 association with substantial morbidity and mortality, the fundamental etiology
 responsible for ASD and majority of cases with it remains unknown..
 The aberrant development of the atrial septum includes heterogeneous complex
 biological processes and identifies important transcription factors involved
 in atrial septation such as Gata4, Nkx2–5 and Tbx5, associated with accurate
 spatial and temporal cooperation of cardiac cells commitment, differentiation
 and proliferation of adhesion molecules, activation and expression of signallin
g molecules, and both environmental and genetic risk factors.
 This may disrupt this natural biological process of cardiogenesis and thus,
 generating a large spectrum of congenital heart defects

 On the contrary, there are families with recurrent ASD secundum having
 a pattern suggesting autosomal dominant inheritance.
 Secundum defects are often encountered in genetic syndromes such as Holt-Oram,
 Ellis van Creveld, Noonan, Down, Budd-Chiari, and Jarcho-Levine.
 The Holt-Oram syndrome is an autosomal dominant trait, described in 1960,
 characterized by congenital heart disease.
 Often ASD secundum combined with delayed electrical atrio-ventricular conductio
n and forelimb malformations, triphalangeal or hypoplastic thumbs are the
 typical features.
 Modern genetics has shown that the syndrome is result of a mutation in
 the TBX5 gene encoding a transcription factor that controls the α-myosin
 heavy chain.
 A decrease in the α-cardiac actin induces apoptosis and it is thought that
 this would lead to an increased rate of absorption or apoptosis of the
 primary atrial septum thereby causing an atrial septal defect of the secundum
 type.
 In patients with the history of trisomy 21, secundum and primum defects
 are the most frequent lesions

 These types include; the Ostium secundum ASDs (resulting from the absence
 or hypoplasia of the primary atrial septum PAS), and the Ostium primum
 ASDs (belonging to the group of defects called atrio-ventricular septal
 defects AVSDs).
 AVSDs are thought to be a result of defective embryonic development of
 embryonic endocardial cushions, Sinus venosus ASDs caused by a defect in
 the incorporation of the sinus venosus chamber into the RA.
 Current research signify that comprehensively predominant ASDs are characterize
d by a common atrium that lacks the primary atrial septum and the spina
 vestibuli or dorsal mesenchymal protrusion, amongst which the ostium secundum
 ASD is the most frequent defect, representing 85% of all ASDs

Secundum atrial septal defect (ASD)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It constitutes up to 75-80 % of ASDs a defect within the fossa ovalis usually
 due to one or several defects within septum primum.
 Extension outside the true limits of the fossa ovalis due to a deficiency
 of the infolding of the atrial wall is common.
 It is refered to as secundum defect because of its occurance at the site
 of the embryologic ostium secundum.
 It is large due to deficiencies in the primary atrial septum.
 It is ovular and sometimes extremely irregular in shape.
 Secundum defects with multiple perforations of the membrane in the fossa
 ovalis may also appear.
 Septum secundum is well-formed in most patients.
 Most secundum defects are not confluent with the vena cavae, right pulmonary
 veins, coronary sinus, or the atrioventricular valves.
 With the exception of patent foramen ovale, secundum atrial septal defect
 is a widely known cause of an atrial-level shunt.
 The size of secundum defects ranges from several millimetres to 2–3 cm.
 Larger defects are usually associated with substantial deficiency, or even
 a complete absence of septum primum

Primum atrial septal defect (ASD)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Constitutes up to 15 % of ASDs and it is a partial form of atrio-ventricular
 canal defect (endocardial cushion defect).
 In ASD primum, the atrial septum superior to the AV valves is deficient
 in making the AV valves to insert at the same level, the normal “off-set”
 between the tricuspid and the mitral valve is lacking.
 The defect is furthermore characterized by a common atrioventricular orifice
 containing two distinct atrioventricular valve annuli completed by valve
 tissue adhering to the crest of the ventricular septum.
 The atrioventricular tissue occludes the space that accounts for the ventricula
r septal defect component in the fully complete form of the malformation
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

.
 Usually the defect is associated with a cleft in the anterior mitral leaflet
 leading to mitral regurgitation.
 ASD primum is typically linked with a left-axis deviation on the ECG.
 This is due to the arrangement of the conduction tissue and not because
 of a damage of a fascicle.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Sinus venosus defect
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Constitutes up to 10 % of ASDs and is characterized by a defect in the most
 posterior and superior parts of the atrial septum at the intersection of
 the superior vena cava and the right atrium.
 The superior vena cava overrides the defect and in a majority of cases,
 anomalous right pulmonary vein connection is found.
 Embryologically, this is caused by a persisting interatrial channel in
 the groove between the right and left atria which also wards off a normal
 connection of the right pulmonary veins.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Patent foramen ovale 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is not a true atrial septal defect as there is no absence of tissue.
 The fibromuscular membrane casing the fossa ovalis serves as a flap valve
 permitting right-to-left atrial shunting which is crucial for the foetal
 life.
 After birth, due to the alteration of the interatrial pressure gradient,
 the foramen ovale becomes functionally closed and eventually anatomically
 fused.
 However, in around 25% of the population, the anatomical fusion fails leaving
 a potential for right-to-left shunting when the pressure of the right atrium
 exceeds that of the left atrium.
 However, rare cases have been reported, where there is a stretch of the
 atrial septum due to left heart disease with increased left atrial pressures,
 making a patent foramen ovale to become a true defect and thereby permitting
 left-to-right shunting.
 Considering the embryology of atrial septation, it is not surprising that
 the patency of foramen ovale is usually inhabiting the cranial part of
 the fossa ovalis Figure

An ASD seldom causes symptoms during childhood, a very large defect may
 allow so much blood flow through, however, and it has been associated with
 frequent respiratory infections, shortness of breath and failure to growth.
 In the adult, symptoms are rare before the age of 40 years but later symptoms
 increase with advancing age, shortness of breath with exertion and palpitations
 due atrial arrhythmias being the most common amongst all symptoms.
 Atrial arrhythmia, resulting from stretching of the conduction system,
 may be the preceding sign of an ASD

 Rarely, a patient with ASD will present with stroke or other systemic ischemic
 event caused by paradoxical embolization of thrombus through the defect.
 With persistent right ventricular volume overload or during hypertensive
 pulmonary vascular disease complications in the ASD right ventricular failure
 may cause peripheral oedema, pleural effusion and ascites.
 In the presence of an ASD, there is a potential for paradoxical embolism,
 however, considering the fact that a majority of ASD patients are females,

Advancement’s in echocardiography have allowed CHDs to be detected as early
 as 17-18 weeks of gestation, and most of which are well tolerated during
 fetal life due its connection with the maternal circulation.
 It is only after birth when that connection is lost.
 Most of the CHDs manifest clinically, some will be incompatible with extra
 uterine life, some clinically apparent within the first few days/weeks
 of life, and others may remain undetected reaching adult life.
 Advances in cardiovascular surgery and intensive care have proved fruitful
 for CHDs correction surgically, and in the future fetal cardiac surgery
 may be a greater possibility for its cure.
 During adulthood, some patients may develop further complications (e.g.
 endocarditis, stroke, systemic or pulmonary hypertension, aortic aneurysm
 or dissection and arrhythmias), and the main causes of their death are
 heart failure and sudden cardiac death.
 Current guidelines emphasize on the surveillance and treatment of adults

 late complications.

Recurrence risks
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The process of evaluating and discussing the recurrence risks of disease
 has to take into account the family history and patient characteristics
 (nature of defect and extracardiac manifestations) to further prevent the
 disease.
 For Mendelian patterns of inheritance this is easily predicted, but one
 also has to consider intra- and inter-familial variability.
 The challenges lie in sporadic non-syndromic patients with CHD.
 According to an estimate familial recurrence of CHD represents 3-5% of
 non-syndromic CHD.
 A prospective multicenter study reported recurrent risks of CHD as 4.1%
 (with an affected parent) and 2.1% (with an affected sibling).
 There appeared to be gender differences with a higher prevalence of CHD
 in the offspring of affected women with CHD (5.7%) than those of affected
 men (2.2%).
 The recurrence risk of ASD for a couple after one affected child is ~3%,
 but it increases to 10% if there are two affected children in the family

 A population based study of 18,000 Danish patients with CHD estimated an
 individual’s risk of CHD in a family with a history of CHD.
 Furthermore, they found that the relative risk for the same type of CHD
 ranged from 3-fold (septal defects) to 80- fold (heterotaxia) in the first
 degree relatives.
 The overall relative risk for the same type of CHD was 8.15, and for any
 other type of CHD was 2.68, the latter indicating that some families have
 a susceptibility towards acquiring CHD

.
 As the population of adults with CHD has increased significantly, and these
 adults have had children themselves, clinicians are now foreseeing more
 families with multiple affected individuals with CHD.
 Many of these families were found to have an autosomal dominant inheritance
 pattern, which can significantly increase the risk of CHD to offspring
 (50%).
 Additionally many cases have been reported with families having no apparent
 family history of CHD, but parents have had more than one child with CHD,
 suggesting an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance (25% recurrence
 risk).
 On the contrary, there is a great variability in the phenotype between
 individuals from the same family.
 These familial recurrences of CHD are a significant resource for molecular
 studies and for the further identification of genes involved in heart developme
nt.

 It is crucial to identify the underlying genetic factor in a patient with
 CHD as there may be: (a) other organ system involvement, (b) prognostic
 information for clinical outcome, (c) important genetic reproductive risks
 for the family, and (d) other family members for whom genetic testing may
 be appropriate.
 With the mainstreaming of clinical genetics services and an increased awareness
 amongst other medical professionals, a great number of patients and families
 with CHD are seen by clinical genetics departments for genetic counseling.
 For many of the patients, the technique of genetic counselling helps to:
 (a) identify and understand the genetic basis of their CHD, (b) provide
 accurate genetic counselling on recurrence risks, and (c) identify and
 manage extracardiac manifestations.
 Although, the majority of the cases has an isolated anomaly and is sporadic,
 some will be syndromic and/or familial, and this will in turn affect the
 nature of genetic counselling for these individuals.

DNA is centralized in the cell nucleus and is organized in 23 pairs of homologou

 Chromosomes consist of chromatin; DNA folded with histone and non-histone
 proteins, and further enables the condensation of the DNA in the nucleus.
 In addition to this, they play a pivotal role in regulatory processes.
 Adding more to this, the chromosomal DNA, a very small portion of the genetic
 information is coded in the mitochondrial genome.
 The DNA is organized in a double helix, in which the four nucleobases adenine
 (A), guanine (G), thymine (T) and cytosine (C) are bound by hydrogen bonds
 in pairs of complementary bases (A and T, G and C).
 Ultimately, they code the information for the transcription of ribonucleic
 acid (RNA) molecules and are then translated into proteins.
 In 1958, Francis Crick formulated this flow of genetic information as the
 “Central Dogma of Molecular Biology.
\end_layout

In total, the human genome consists of approximately 3,200 megabases and
 contains about 25,000 protein-coding genes, which correspond to only 1-2%

 of the non-coding portion of the genome has long been considered as “junk
 DNA” serving no specific biological function.
 However, recent studies like the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE)
 project, which assigned biochemical function to 80% of the human genome16,
 gave rise to a lively debate about the nature of non-coding DNA and the
 definition of biological function, which will have to be refined in the

Mutations are classified based on their size, biochemical nature and functional
 effect.
 Single nucleotide variations (SNVs) only change one nucleotide and it can
 be of following types; silent, missense (altering the protein’s amino acid
 sequence) or nonsense (coding for a translation stop).
 Missense mutations can be devastating to the protein’s function or can
 be benign, e.g.
 when the amino acid is exchanged for a functionally conserved residue.
 Besides coding regions, SNVs can also influence regulatory elements like
 promoters, enhancers, transcription factor binding sites or splice junctions
 as well as ncRNAs, thus potentially affecting regulatory mechanisms.
 Profoundly common SNVs with a population frequency of ≥1% are denoted as
 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).
 The second class of local variations are short insertions or deletions
 with a length ranging from only a few base pairs (usually <5bp), which
 are referred to as InDels.
 They can prove to be potentially very harmful by altering the reading frame
 of coding sequences.
 Moreover, only InDels of triplets will keep the reading frame intact.
 However, they still are able to alter the amino acid sequence of the resulting
 protein

Copy number variations (CNVs) are submicroscopic structural variations that
 alter the copy number of entire genes or genomic regions.
 CNVs can result in Mendelian diseases or complex sporadic syndromes by
 various molecular mechanisms, including; altered gene dosage, gene fusion,
 gene disruption and position effects.
 However, they can also be found as benign polymorphic variations[75, 76].Conclus
ively, numerical chromosomal abnormalities (aneuploidies) like monosomies
 or trisomies represent a major mutational threat and are the leading cause
 for miscarriages and congenital defects in human.
 Most of the aneuploidies are lethal during embryonic development; others
 may cause severe syndromic disorders affecting multiple organ systems.
 The identification of trisomy 21 as the cause for Down syndrome in 1959,
 provided the first link between a chromosome abnormality and a clinical

 WES does not cover untranslated regions, enhancers, and long-noncoding
 RNAs, which may be potentially functional and helpful in diagnosing various
 diseases.
 Structural variations such as ; the copy number variants, translocations,
 and inversions are also not included in whole exome sequencing.
 Despite these downfalls, whole exome sequencing is still broadly used among
 researchers due to its cost effectiveness, robustness, and timeliness.

\begin_layout Standard
When compared to whole genome sequencing, WES costs five times less, has
 a higher coverage depth of 100x versus 30x, and requires a short processing
 time since only a sixth of the genome is used for the analysis.
 Additionally, most allelic variants that have been found to be main reason
 behind the Mendelian disorders disrupting protein-coding sequences, which
 can easily be detected via exome sequencing.
 Variants in the exome sequences also have a larger effect size rather than
 those within non-coding sequences even in highly conserved regions.
 Henceforth, considering all these reasons our lab has chosen to perform
 whole exome sequencing on the mutant mice.

EVOLUTIONARY CONSERVATION
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Evolutionary conservation is crucial in providing support for genes that
 may contribute to disease.
 Conservation means that the amino acids at a certain position are the same
 throughout a set of species.
 Mutations in regions that are highly conserved are more likely to result
 in a disease than those that are less conserved or not conserved at all.
 It has been reported as a basic criterion for examining the disease causing
 potential of an amino acid or nucleotide sequence change.
 Research done by Pierpont et al.
 describes three criteria used to establish the disease causing potential
 of a mutation.
 These criteria include: a sequence change that alters the gene coding sense,
 gene splice site, or regulatory region of the protein; segregates with
 disease in a kindred; and is not found in unrelated, unaffected control
 chromosomes.
 Some mutations may also be considered as conserved if the changed in the
 amino acid residue has similar properties of the original residue.
 Comparisons of the sequences of the same protein in different species helped
 researchers to pinpoint those residues that are structurally or functionally
 vital as these are conserved.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mutations may be tolerated or considered nonthreatening, as long as the
 change does not destroy or seriously alter the protein’s function.
 Mutations are damaging, or threatening, when there are changes in side
 chains that are involved in binding substrates or cofactors, that interact
 with other proteins, or that participate in catalytic mechanisms altering
 or wrecking the protein’s function.
