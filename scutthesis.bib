  abstract      = {Because of the increasing availability of tools for genetic manipulation, the mouse has become the most popular animal model for studying normal and abnormal cardiac development. However, despite the enormous advances in mouse genetics, which have led to the production of numerous mutants with cardiac abnormalities resembling those seen in human congenital heart disease, relatively little comparative work has been published to demonstrate the similarities and differences in the developmental cardiac anatomy in both species. In this review we discuss some aspects of the comparative anatomy, with emphasis on the atrial anatomy, the valvuloseptal complex, and ventricular myocardial development. From the data presented it can be concluded that, apart from the obvious differences in size, the mouse and human heart are anatomically remarkably similar throughout development. The partitioning of the cardiac chambers (septation) follows the same sequence of events, while also the maturation of the cardiac valves and myocardium is quite similar in both species. The major anatomical differences are seen in the venous pole of the heart. We conclude that, taking note of the few anatomical "variations," the use of the mouse as a model system for the human heart is warranted. Thus the analysis of mouse mutants with impaired septation will provide valuable information on cellular mechanisms involved in valvuloseptal morphogenesis (a process often disrupted in congenital heart disease), while the study of embryonic lethal mouse mutants that present with lack of compaction of ventricular trabeculae will ultimately provide clues on the etiology of this abnormality in humans.},
